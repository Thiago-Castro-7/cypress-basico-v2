# Cypress Basico
Sample project to Talking About Testing
## Pre-requirements
It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

I used versions v16.13.2 and 8.3.2 of Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later versions.

## Installation
Run npm install (or npm i for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests
You can run the test simulating a desktop or mobile viewport.

### Desktop
Run 'npm test' (or 'npm t' for the short version) to run the test in headless mode on desktop viewport.

Or, 'run npm run cy:open' to open Cypress in interactive mode on desktop viewport.
### Mobile
Run 'npm run teste:mobile' to run the test in headless mode on mobile viewport.

Or, 'run npm run cy:open' to open Cypress in interactive mode on mobile viewport.
